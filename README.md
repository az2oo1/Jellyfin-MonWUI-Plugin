## Overview

Jellyfin MonWUI Plugin, installed in Jellyfin as **JMSFusion**, is an all-in-one frontend enhancement layer built around the modular slider system in `Resources/slider/`.

Instead of adding a single visual tweak, it upgrades the full browsing experience: home screen presentation, metadata density, hover interactions, profile flow, music playback, pause behavior, library discovery, and settings management.

The goal is simple: make Jellyfin feel more polished, more personal, and more premium without turning the interface into a mess.

- **Slider engine** with per-profile list control, random or manual content sourcing, query-string tuning, balancing rules, and refresh logic that keeps rows up to date.
- **Visual layouts** including Compact, Normal, Full Screen, and Peak mode, with optional diagonal presentation and manual positioning controls for theme compatibility.
- **Home screen enhancements** such as hero cards, enhanced details modal, personal recommendations, recent rows, director rows, and quality-aware card treatment.
- **Hover preview system** with Netflix-like trailer behavior plus a lighter popover alternative when a full preview is not desired.
- **Pause and playback upgrades** including Smart Pause, maturity indicators, metadata-rich pause overlays, GMMP music playback, lyrics tools, and subtitle customization.
- **Profile personalization** with avatar generation, built-in avatar picking, and a dedicated "Who's Watching?" flow for fast profile switching.
- **Library and notification tools** including Studio Hubs, watchlist integration, newly added notifications, update notices, and continue-watching style surfaces.
- **Advanced utilities** including trailer and theme video helper workflows, NFO support, backup/restore, multilingual UI labels, and admin-only global settings control.

## Installation

This repository is **Jellyfin MonWUI Plugin**, but the plugin appears inside Jellyfin as **JMSFusion**.

1. Open your **Jellyfin Dashboard**.
2. Go to **Plugins -> Repositories**.
3. Add this repository URL:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/G-grbz/Jellyfin-MonWUI-Plugin/main/manifest.json
```

4. Go to **Plugins -> Available**.
5. Find and install **JMSFusion**.
6. Restart Jellyfin.

## Uninstall

1. Open **Jellyfin -> Plugins**.
2. Uninstall **JMSFusion**.
3. Restart Jellyfin.
4. Return to the home page.
5. Hard refresh the browser a few times with **Ctrl + F5**.

## Notes

- After install, update, or uninstall, a hard refresh with **Ctrl + F5** is recommended to clear cached assets.
- The slider may need a couple of refresh attempts before every UI asset is fully replaced.
- Some advanced automation modules are optional and may require admin access, API keys, or additional server-side tools depending on your setup.
- If you use Watchlist and want to hide the default Jellyfin Favorites tab, add the following CSS to the Jellyfin custom CSS area:
```text
  
  button.emby-tab-button.emby-button[data-index="1"] {
    display: none !important;
}
```

## Acknowledgment

The original idea behind the JMS slider and its integration approach inside Jellyfin's web UI was conceived by **BobHasNoSoul**. The JMS concept is built on that foundation.
